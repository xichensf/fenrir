# FENRIR: Tissue-specific enhancer functional network inference
The FENRIR framework included two parts: first, a Bayesian integration model created tissue-specific enhancer functional networks; and second, a network-based machine learning model prioritized disease-enhancer association in a tissue-specific manner. 

This work was predicated on the hypothesis that an enhancer will have a strong tissue-specific functional relationship with another enhancer if they share particular attributes: interacting in the 3D genome, co-regulated by TFs, and/or regulating genes functionally related in a tissue. Using a Bayesian integration model, FENRIR integrated TF co-regulation for pairs of enhancers, chromatin interactions between enhancers and genes with tissue-specific functional relatedness for pairs of genes. Each resulting FENRIR network included probabilistically weighted interactions between pairwise enhancers, representing the functional similarity of these enhancers in a given tissue; and probabilities for physically interactive enhancers and genes, representing their tissue-specificity. 

For the second FENRIR model of disease-enhancer association prediction, a learned context-specific enhancer network was combined with disease knowledge (GWAS SNPs or disease-associated genes for a disease, such as the SFARI genes for ASD). To do this we trained a network-based classifier using elastic net logistic regression and prioritized disease associations for all enhancers
