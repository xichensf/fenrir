# FENRIR: Tissue-specific enhancer functional network inference
This work was predicated on the hypothesis that an enhancer will have a strong tissue-specific functional relationship with another enhancer if they share particular attributes: interacting in the 3D genome, co-regulated by TFs, and/or regulating genes functionally related in a tissue. Using a Bayesian integration model, FENRIR integrated TF co-regulation for pairs of enhancers, chromatin interactions between enhancers and genes with tissue-specific functional relatedness for pairs of genes. FENRIR iteratively sampled enhancer subnetworks (each with a subset of enhancers and genes) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), predicted the functional relatedness of sampled enhancers in each subnetwork and finally inferred a global enhancer functional network by summing all local predictions together. During the sampling process, for a pair of enhancers sampled as functionally related, their interactions to the two supporting target genes will be sampled, too. Then, each resulting FENRIR network included probabilistically weighted interactions between pairwise enhancers, representing the functional similarity of these enhancers in a given tissue; and probabilities for physically interactive enhancers and genes, representing their tissue-specificity.
